# lending-club
This directory contains several files that describe an analysis of lending club loans, with the goal of predicting which loans will go bad. Its intended audience is those at least somewhat familiar with data science methods and machine learning.  However, the introduction and executive summary does contain an overview of the results that's intended for a more general audience.

Thanks for checking out the documents and please feel free to e-mail me with comments!

The files in this directory are:
* lending-club.Rmd               an R markdown document that performs the analysis and can be used to generate a PDF report.
* lending-club.pdf               a PDF report of the analysis
* LoanStats3a_securev1.csv.gz    a gzip'd data file that was obtained from Lending Club and used in this analysis
